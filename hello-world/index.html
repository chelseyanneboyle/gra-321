      My name is Chelsey Boyle. I am a third graphic design student at Arizona State University. My favorite aspect of design right now is creating custom typefaces. <br>
       I am excited to continue learning about graphic design and hope to someday work for an imapctful, sustainable company like Patagonia.<h4>
